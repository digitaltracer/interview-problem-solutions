"""
Given a string `s` and a number `k` find all the substrings of length `k` that occurs more than once in `s`

    This is the naive approach. With this we get time complexity of O((n-k)*k) with the same space complexity as well.
    since in the worst case, our set can contain (nâˆ’k+1) elements, and at each iteration of the traversal,
    we are allocating memory to generate a new k-length substring.

The performance can be improved to O(n) TC and SC by using Rabin-Karp algorithm that utilizes sliding window with
rolling hash for pattern matching. Rolling hash is used to prevent rehashing the whole string while calculating hash 
values of the substrings of a given string.
