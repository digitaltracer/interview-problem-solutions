# Description:
"""
You are given an undirected graph as an adjacency matrix consisting of 'v' vertices and an integer 'm'.

You need to return 'YES' if you can color the graph using at most 'm' colors so that no two adjacent vertices
are the same. Else, return 'NO'.

Same question's variation in LC 1042
You have n gardens, labeled from 1 to n, and an array paths where paths[i] = [xi, yi] describes a bidirectional path
between garden xi to garden yi. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

All gardens have at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have
different types of flowers.

Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)th garden.
The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

Note: In this solution we will be using matrix representation of a graph.
