# Description:
"""
Given an array arr, partition it into two subsets (possibly empty) such that their union is the original array.
Let the sum of these two arrays be s1 and s2.
Given the different d, count the number of partitions in which s1 is greater than or equal to s2 and the difference
between s1 and s2 is equal to d
