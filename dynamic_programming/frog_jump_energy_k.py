# Description:
"""
There is a frog on the 1st step of an n stairs long staircase. The frog wants to reach nth stair.
height[i] is the height of (i+1)th stair. If frog jumps from ith to jth stair, the energy lost in the jump is given
by |height[i-1] - height[j-1]|.

If the frog is on ith staircase it can either jump to (i+1) to (i+k) stair. Your task is to find the minimum total
energy used by the frog to reach nth stair from 1st stair.
